        <h3>Vulnerabilities:</h3>
        <p>Outdated security protocols like WEP and weak passwords leave networks exposed to brute-force attacks, allowing hackers to intercept data and compromise sensitive information.</p>

        <h3>Protection Tips:</h3>
        <p>Utilizing WPA3 encryption, implementing strong password policies, and employing network monitoring tools are essential for securing your network.</p>
